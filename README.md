# How to get started

Copy and paste the run command:

`wget run "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbauer516/ftb/main/cc-tweaked/download.lua"`

If you run the command in a CC: Tweaked computer, it will download this REPO for use. I suggest copying it to a floppy disk as a master record. Edit the default version in the download.lua file to change the version.
